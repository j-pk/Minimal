An improved reddit client to help users see the bigger picture

This app was my original creation that complemented the Reddit website when there was no official app and few third-party options in the App Store. Originally named mit√© in the App Store in 2015. It offered the following features:

- Dynamic view options: Transform subreddit thumbnails into first-party candidates, enabling users to switch between compact, media, multi-row, and more.
- Custom theming: Personalize the app's visual style to suit your preferences.
- OAuth integration: Seamlessly authenticate and refresh your Reddit account within the app.
- Commenting on posts: Engage with the Reddit community by leaving comments.
- And other helpful features like: Pull-to-refresh, Search, Favoriting, and Filtering posts and subreddits. 

This version represents a renamed upgrade of the original app I had on worked on years ago. It would of been neat having another go utilzing some more modern APIs that Apple has since released. 

I enjoyed reddit, but I wonder what's next?
